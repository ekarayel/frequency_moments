# Frequency Moments

Isabelle is an interactive theorem prover, which can be used to verify mathematical theorems, as well the correctness of algorithms, protocols or hardware.
This repository contains the formal verification of randomized, approximate space-efficient streaming algorithms for frequency moments with Isabelle/HOL.
